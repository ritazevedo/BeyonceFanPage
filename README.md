# Beyonc√© Fan Page üé§

This project was developed during a 24-hour Hackathon where the main theme was the Super Bowl Half Time Show, focusing
on Beyonc√© as our assigned sub-theme. Our team created a single-page application‚Äîa fan page dedicated to Beyonc√©. We
developed a custom API from scratch and designed an interactive world map feature.

her shows around the world. The interactive world map allows users to explore and view images from her concerts in
specific countries.
